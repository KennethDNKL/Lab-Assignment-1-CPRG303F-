## System Requirements for React Native Development:
***

## System requirements

##### *CPU:*
* A modern multi-core processor (e.g., Intel Core i5 or higher).

##### *RAM Size:* 
* At least 8GB of RAM is recommended, but having 16GB or more is better for smooth development.

##### *Windows Version:* 
* You can develop React Native apps on Windows 10 or higher.

## Installation Instructions:

##### *Node.js:*

* Download the Node.js installer from nodejs.org.
* Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
##### *React Native CLI:*

* Open your command prompt or terminal.
Run npm install -g react-native-cli to install the React Native CLI globally.

## Configuration Steps:

##### *Environment Variables (Optional):*
* It's recommended to add Node.js and npm to your system's PATH variable for easier command-line access. You can find this setting in the system's Advanced System Settings.
## Project Creation:

##### 1. *Create a New React Native Project:*

* Open your command prompt or terminal.
* Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
* Run npx react-native init MyProjectName (replace "MyProjectName" with your project's name).
* This command sets up a new React Native project with all the necessary files and dependencies.
##### 2. *Navigate to the Project Directory:*

* Move to the project directory using cd MyProjectName (replace "MyProjectName" with your project's name).

## Running the Project in an Android Device Simulator:

##### 1. *Android Studio Setup:*

* Install Android Studio if you haven't already.
* Open Android Studio, go to the "Configure" menu, and select "AVD Manager."
* Create a virtual device (Android emulator) that matches your testing requirements.

##### 2. *Start the Android Emulator:*

* In Android Studio, open your virtual device from the AVD Manager.
* Click the "Play" button to start the emulator.

##### 3. *Run the React Native App:*

* In your project directory, run npx react-native run-android.
* This command builds and deploys your app to the Android emulator.


## Troubleshooting:

##### 1. *Debugging:*

* To debug your app, press Ctrl + M (or Cmd + M on macOS) in the emulator. This will open the Developer Menu for debugging options.

##### 2. *Error Messages:*

* If you encounter error messages, read them carefully. They often provide hints about what went wrong.
* You can search for the error message online, as others may have encountered the same issue and shared solutions.

##### 3. *Community Support:*

* React Native has a large community, and you can find solutions to common issues on forums like Stack Overflow or in the React Native documentation.
